The Problem:

A roller coaster car of mass m=500kg starts from rest at a height h=40m above the ground. It travels down a frictionless track and goes through a circular loop of radius R = 10m R=10m.
What is the speed of the car at the top of the loop?
(Solve this using conservation of energy.)

Solution: 
	
v= (2g(h−2R))^1/2
 ≈19.8m/s
Assumptions Hunted:

Closed System
Energy not created/destroyed
Classical definitions
Conservative force (gravity)
Absolute time & space

Breakdowns & Implications:

Expanding Universe: Challenges global energy conservation (-> Cosmology)
Dark Energy: Seems to violate energy conservation (-> Quantum Field Theory)
Quantum Fluctuations: Allow temporary violation (-> Quantum Mechanics)
